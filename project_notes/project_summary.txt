# Biographica Protein Information Project - Summary

## Project Structure
- Created a modular structure with src/ containing data/, components/, and pages/
- Moved parquet files to data/ directory
- Set up Poetry for dependency management
- Implemented logging with loguru

## Data Files (in data/ directory)
- protein_nodes.parquet: 27,768 rows with protein information (id, name, sequence, etc.)
- go_term_nodes.parquet: 9,594 rows with GO term information (go_id, name, namespace, etc.)
- edges.parquet: 498,731 rows of relationships (FunctionalAnnotation or ProteinProteinInteraction)
- protein_id_records.parquet: 27,768 rows mapping UUIDs to secondary identifiers

## Key Components Created
- DataLoader class to handle parquet loading and provide search functionality
- Dash application with Bootstrap styling for the user interface
- Components for protein and GO term display
- Network visualization of protein-protein interactions using Dash Cytoscape
- Page layouts for home, search results, protein details, and about page

## Technical Challenges
- Dependency issues with PyArrow installation on WSL
- Workarounds implemented:
  - Modified DataLoader to use DuckDB for parquet file loading
  - Updated DataLoader to handle inconsistencies in the data model
  - Added robust handling for cases where protein IDs exist in edges but not in protein_id_records
  - Created installation script to use pre-built wheels

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing of the enhanced DataLoader
2. Ensure proper functioning of the Dash application
3. Add more advanced search functionality
4. Enhance network visualization capabilities
5. Improve UI/UX based on user feedback
